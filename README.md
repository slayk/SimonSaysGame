# Simon Says Game

This website is for the gameplay of the famous - Simon Says Game!
- It is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Click anywhere on the screen to get started.
- As it starts with level one, it makes a blink on the chosen colour and also, makes a sound. You need to keep that in mind and press the same button.
- Keep proceeding this with new added blinks and sounds. Follow the pattern. 
- Once you fail at any stage, the level resets to 1 with a "Lost" sound.

Hope you enjoy playing the game, as much as I enjoyed making it.
